<h2>Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
<p>My name is Jason Heppler, and I'm the creator and writer here.  I’m married and live in Lincoln, Nebraska, where I am the Project Manager of the William F. Cody Digital Archive at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and a Ph.D. student in the Department of History at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  My fields of study are the history of computing and computers, the history of programming, humanities computing, and digital history.

<p>I am a 26 year old developer, technology enthusiast, digital historian, and a number of other things. I love learning and working with technology. Technology has always been a passion. When I was young, I learned the ins and outs of computer software and hardware. I frequently tore down computers to learn how they worked (or didn't work) and early on was introduced to the power of the web. I started this blog to share my knowledge and learn from readers.

<p>What you’ll find here are three main post types: links, perspectives, and reviews. I link to things I’ve read or found that I find interesting. Perspectives are my thoughts on a variety of topics or notes about my fields of study. Reviews are what I think about books, software, services, and hardware. I mainly focus on a wide array of history, scholarship, and technology, but will stray from time to time. I also use this space as a notebook for thinking about project management, user experiences, culture, the web, and more.

<p>I care about making, creating, doing, and simplicity.

<h2>What is Digital History?</h2>
<p>The advent of digital technologies is changing and challenging the ways historians practice their craft. The way we collect, present, and store information has changed rapidly in the last twenty years. Digital history is several things: a methodology meant to aid the traditional art and practice of historians, the use of digital tools to gain insight into information that cannot be done with a legal pad and pen, allows historians to disseminate and present their information in new ways, and a means to reach wide audiences through digital technologies. The goal isn’t cliometrics 2.0 or to augment the theory-driven social sciences, but to abide by the historian’s commitment to complexity and nuance while utilizing digital technologies to aid that task.

<h2>What hardware do you use?</h2>
<p>A MacBook Pro with a 13" monitor, usually paired with an external 17″ widescreen monitor.

<p>Other indispensable tools include a small notepad (for those sudden brainstorms or important information) and a permanent marker and sheets of paper for sketching ideas.

<h2>What about software?</h2>
<p>Mostly: <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="TextMate — The Missing Editor for Mac OS X">TextMate</a>, <a href="http://getdropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git - Fast Version Control System">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" title="Apple - Safari - Browse the web in smarter, more powerful ways.">Safari</a>/<a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox/" title="Mozilla | Firefox web browser &amp; Thunderbird email client">Firefox</a>/<a href="http://google.com/chrome" title="Google Chrome - Get a fast new browser.

<h2>Talk about the design</h2>
<p>The design is inspired by several sources, including <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" title="breathe. | zen habits">ZenHabits</a>, <a href="http://smarterware.org/" title="Smarterware by Gina Trapani | A blog about software">Smarterware</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/" title="Daring Fireball">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/" title="patrickrhone / journal">Patrick Rhone</a>, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/" title="Shawn Blanc">Shawn Blanc</a>, <a href="http://brooksreview.net" title="The Brooks Review">Ben Brooks</a>, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/" title="PaulStamatiou.com &mdash; Tech News, Reviews and Guides">Paul Stamatiou</a>, and <a href="http://52tiger.net/" title="52 Tiger">52Tiger</a>. I’ve borrowed the phrase "History in the Digital" from <a href="http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/issues/952/interchange/index.html" title="JAH - The Promise of Digital History">Prof. William G. Thomas</a>.

<h2>Books</h2>
<p>My first ebook, The Rubyist Historian: Ruby Fundamentals for Humanist Scholars, was written in early 2011 in an effort to share my knowledge of Ruby programming with other historians and humanities scholars interested in integrating programming into their day-to-day activities. Check out the <a href="{{site.base_url}}the-rubyist-historian-the-series/">book's page </a>to download a copy or contribute your own expertise to the text (coming soon).
